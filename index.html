            <h3>Reedpop</h3>
                <p>As a summer intern at Reedpop, I had many different responsibilities. I learned the program Salesforce and used it to book artists for artist alley for both NYCC and KCC. I even taught others around the office to use the software. I monitored different show social media accounts and took notes on fan interaction. I sent out retailer packages for local stores to sell badges to upcoming comic cons, and even got hands on experience working at Book Expo at the Jacob Javits Convention Center, helping attendees from behind an info desk. It was all an exciting experience for which I am very grateful.</p>
            <h3>Ithaca College Campus Center Events</h3>
                <p>I spent a semester planning remote events for Ithaca College students during a semester that took place during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Some of these events include a weekly cooking show (of which there were 10), and monthly game nights (of which there were 3). 
                    <br> As the host of the remote cooking show, I also created scoial content for the campus Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook, and edited the cooking show into short form videos for social engagement.
